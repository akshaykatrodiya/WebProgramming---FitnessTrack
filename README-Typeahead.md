## Two different auto-complete Typeahead search implemented
- Client side for all available activities.
- Server side for all active users.

## What I used/built
- FormBuilder, FormGroup modules from angular forms
- Directive to make an easy implementation of search method
- Built a custom pipe for filter the data
- In exercise search: took the exercise data into separate model and filtered at client side using custom pipe from shared
- In gymgoers(users) search: tried to bring data from the server by calling api from a searchAPI and filtered using the same custom pipe
